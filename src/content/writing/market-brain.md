Being french gives you great appreciation for the virtues of markets. Frédéric Bastiat long gone (and completely forgotten), the perverse economic incentives and well-meaning subsidies ending in disaster are our bread and butter. Giant stacks of tax money are burned for little to no results. Politicians accurately praising markets for what they're good are a minority in virtually every party.
"And yet it moves". Repeated attempts at shooting ourselves in the foot have left us a country with its pros and cons and not a desolate wasteland. A sillicon valley expert will blame the cost of education and healthcare in the US on over-regulation hindering the free market. Meanwhile, France has restricted supply and subzidized demand all the way to the moon in ways anglo-saxon understanding would never dare to, and it has barely moved the needle.
What does that say? It's not solving economics, but it tells me that markets are incredibly powerful tools, not exclusive idols to be chased for their own sake.

The reification of markets is a weird thing, on both accounts.
For some people everything is markets and market dynamics, including stuff that clearly don't behave like one. These people will read Freakonomics and nod along. They will actively participate to market-ify what they can.
And then there are people that blatantly don't understand how markets work or all the good they've done, unable to leave them where they are and focus on the rest. They'd have you central plan everything and will not budge.
To me it feels less than just a polarized ideological divide, and more some sort of a personality test. I'm definitely in camp #1, and feel that there is a seductive quality in projecting every issue into supply vs. demand.

It reminds me of our collective obsession for ranking. Ranking people, ranking things. Making tier lists and leaderboards. If you can assign values and project stuff to a single number, great!
In the dating market, 6s may date 7s or 8s but never 5s or 9s. See, by mathematical science love triangle can't exist, because if A is into B and B is into C and C is into A, that'd mean A > B > C > A and that doesn't make sense, now does it?
There is a dehumanizing effect to that, reducing people to numbers isn't making them a great service. Markets have fungibility, participants are cogs to be swapped. When I see something as a market, it makes me instantly less interested in participating. I'll take my copy of _Das Kapital_, leave the fordist factory, and go be a craftman in the shed by myself.

But, overwhemingly, it's a matter of explanatory power. Viewing some domains as a market, a set of fungible supply and demand, fails to predict much. To me, it feels like we reach out for that mental model out of habit, because it's such a driving force of modern life. I need to actively check myself to make sure I consider other, more useful, framings. As always, reality has more details than that.
