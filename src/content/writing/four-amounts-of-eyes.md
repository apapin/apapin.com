In Kundera's _The unbearable lightness of being_, one of the characters postulates that everyone needs someone to look at them but that we all fall into one of four categories according to "the kind of look we wish to live under."

Here they are:

- The first category wants "an infinite number of anonymous eyes." They're seeking fame, the gaze of the public. They want to be a nexus of parasocial relationships.
- The second category wants "to be looked at by many known eyes." They're looking for a sense of community; they want to belong. They like cocktail parties and all sorts of gatherings.
- The third category is made of "people who need to be constantly before the eyes of the person they love." They seek a company of two and live through their partner's eyes.
- The fourth category is looking for "the imaginary eyes of those who are not present." They're dreamers; they tell themselves stories. They fall in love with someone they barely know but may run when it gets real.

I think about this regularly. It might hold some explanatory power as to how people live their lives and what they optimize for. If anything, I find it helpful to think about what I'm looking for.
