I think we have come to tolerate both too much and not enough.

There is a crisis around our growing inability to handle negative experiences. We've built so many systems of convenience that we made ourselves allergic to discomfort, so timid that we rarely dare to pursue what we want.

On the other side, there is a hustle culture and its cousins. We internalize that big things require big efforts, relentless dedication, and self-sacrifice. The underlying fallacy is that the rewards are proportional to how hard it was to get there. And so we bestow value to the grind. It's true in some circumstances, but not always. We have built a narrative to justify our worst instincts of repression, frustration, self-censorship, restraint, and renunciation. We refuse to think about how much better things could be, because staring at it makes our head spins. Unable to deal with the discomfort of exploration, we enter exploitation mode by default.

The potential for self-sabotage is colossal. When stuck in a bad situation, the easiest way to avoid discomfort is to keep still. Bias towards the status quo isn't new, but our unwillingness to confront it strengthens it. And then, we can rationalize our inaction by convincing ourselves that any suffering caused by a bad situation must be a sign of being on a path worthy to pursue.

Maybe you're stuck in a bad relationship but unwilling to face the discomfort of being alone, and justifying it by saying true love requires compromise and hard work. Maybe you're stuck in a mediocre job sucking your soul but unwilling to ask yourself what you want to be doing, and your brain is rationalizing it as a necessary part of life. Maybe you've been doing things purely out of auto-piloting your way toward high status at the cost of self-realization, and thinking the recognition you get has to be worth the price you pay, even though it fails to fill your inner void.

Asking ourselves hard questions or risking rejection has become so painful for our modern selves that we would rather claim martyrdom and victimhood than shake things up.

Here is a principle I'd like to live by: it should never feel bad. If you're where you should be then things should feel effortless. If you're not there yet, if you feel it grinding away at you, then you should trust your internal compass and get out. When you get there, you'll be certain of it. Until then, do not settle and do not compromise.

Even dedication to a craft or the pursuit of big things only works out of engines you cannot torture yourself into.

Good things feel easy; they're just hard to find.
