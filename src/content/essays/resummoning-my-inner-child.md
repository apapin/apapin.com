I'm sure therapists would have a field day on that one, but as I hit my thirties, I'm genuinely puzzled by how much of my self-improvement work consists of attempts at reverting to a child. 

It's not nostalgia - I've had awful teenage years as a lost nerd with crippling shyness and a boring kidhood. It's more looking back and asking myself, "when the fuck did I get that bad habit?". Or me trying to describe my perfect mind state and realizing it's basically me when I was 12. Are these the prices you pay for growing up in other places? Am I idealizing the mad ravings of my undeveloped brain from back then? 

The most salient example is the ability to get excited about anything or everything. Your world is extremely small when you are a child. Whatever you're on about now is your everything, and you pour every bit of passion into it. You move through things with an extreme sense of earnestness. As an adult, I feel very controlled, very blas√©. Most things I view through five layers of cynicism, the "I've been there before" type of thing. I still have the same inner drive and sense of wonder, but it's almost like it's automatically repressed if I'm not careful enough, and I have to actively channel it. 
I remember crying about some homework like it was the end of the world. I remember being incredibly excited about a simple idea. I remember being more worried about viruses or radioactivity than I have been about anything in my life days after learning about them. I remember reading a series of three or four novels in one go when I was a teen and falling in love with a character. It was some insane true-to-life love that I've rarely ever felt with an actual person. My adult self would kill that feeling before it even emerged. 

As a kid, your life is built around play - fucking around and finding out. You have less of a sense of overthinking consequences, and the correct built-in rule that the best way to figure out how you feel about something is to try it. You're really tied down by the gravity of anxiety. It's not just that you don't have bills to pay or don't have to think about what you'll cook this evening; it's genuine carelessness about what's going to happen next. 

Before the teenage years, you also have a stunning lack of care for what other people think. You do things for their sake and aren't filtering your intentions through 29 layers of social acceptance or what-will-that-girl-think. I'm particularly self-conscious, but I won't believe that everyone else didn't also have it better as a kid. 

You are, by virtue of not knowing anything, constantly outside of your comfort zone. There is no resting on your non-existing laurels. You're always asking "why?" and expanding the boundaries of your knowledge. As an adult, you have to force yourself into it, sometimes through great effort. 

So what is growing up good for? As Montaigne would say, growing old is growing unique. All newborns are the same but no two 80y olds are identical. I'm not that far into it, but I like it a lot. It has brought me peace of mind on a lot of things. Still, I find it funny having to relearn as lessons things you came to the world with as factory defaults.
