Something fundamental to my morality views is that dismissing people based on external superficial characteristics, like belonging to a certain demographic, is bad. This is not exactly revolutionary but I don't see it framed in a way that resonates with me often, so let me take a shot at that.

The all-time worst instances of these heuristics are racism, sexism, and similar discriminations. As milquetoast as that is, it occurs to me that people thinking these are bad don't quite agree with me on why it is, and won't generalize it quite like I do.
Dismissing people for their physical appearance or their mannerism is another one. Credentialism is another one. Various forms of judging people over their social status, whether they're in/outgroup, etc. Anything that amounts to not letting people stand on their merit, achievements, or being.
It's a reason why I like the internet in general. Hiding behind pseudonymity removes the existence of some of these heuristics, and forces people

People-heuristics are bad both in terms of their consequences and on principle:

- People in power applying these heuristics hurt people in the groups they're targeting.
- We're all worse off because these behaviors lead to suboptimal decisions.
- People who are in a habit of using these heuristics instead of thinking things through are worse off because they make bad decisions.
- There is something inherently dehumanizing and unfair for people who are judged in that way.

Importantly, and in a way that I'm not sure how to articulate, the fact that people-heuristics are evil only marginally relates to their utility.

To give an example: racists are out there in the wild spending their collective brainpower trying to argue that science proves that people of a certain race have a 1.21% lower IQ. Notwithstanding the usual objections that IQ probably doesn't measure anything real, that it's all cofounded with access to opportunities, education, and tons of other variables — what are they even trying to insinuate? Are you supposed to start judging whether people are smart based on that? Is that a useful thing to wonder about in any way?

You can also listen to someone, their ideas, and what they're saying, and judge them based on that. Any 10 minutes conversation will tell you much more about someone than any weird weak proxy you care about. The evil is in dismissing real people and not giving them a chance to stand on their merit because of a collective statistical appreciation.

If anything, I rank these people-heuristics based off how many people they purpose to judge at once. I'm weary of gender or country wide declarations that fit so many people into a single bundle that they can only be wrong.

The only reason people-heuristics make sense, as other heuristics do, is that they're easy and cheap to apply. If you're recruiting for a job, maybe you'll decide to only take applicants from a top-tier school. This is an incredibly good way to miss the best people — those with unique perspectives and a non-conformist bent. Having recruited in startups, I'm convinced half their success is a product of accepting or even encouraging unconventional profiles, giving chances to people that Big Corp Inc. wouldn't approach, and thrusting 22y olds into executive roles.

But if you're Big Corp Inc. and you get 2000 CVs for a single role in a week, maybe you have to apply some heuristics and only accept coming from top schools. This is worse than testing everyone on their merits in some other way but may be a necessary evil. Diplomas relate to competence somewhat but are an imperfect signal, and relying on them is also a form of gatekeeping and a perpetuation of an imperfect society relying on proxies instead of getting closer to the ground truth.
