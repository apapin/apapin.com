I grew up on the internet. I got my first 56k modem in the early 2000s, when I was about 11 or 12. First it was the family computer, and then it moved to my room, and then I got online. 

I'm from the last generation to feel my education constrained by the physical world. As a child with bottomless curiosity, I was obsessed by a giant encyclopedia of thousands of razor thin pages, and any book I could get my hand on. It was never enough. Until I got online.

In the real world I was a shy kid, too anxious to open up, too weird and gifted to relate to classmates. On the internet I was just a pseudonym and an avatar, I was talking to adults as their equal. 

Among countless others, I have memories of playing a multiplayer text roleplaying game when I was 15. Meeting new people and making friends. I remember blushing when the people I was playing with made references I couldn't get because of my age. I got complimented for writing well. 
And then I decided to build my own version of the game. I worked with a few other players, decades older then me. We created lore, started programming it, invited people to join. I was managing a project and a team from my bedroom, through my CRT screen, in the middle of high school. 

Internet at its best is what every parent should want for their children. A stimulating infinite space to play and experiment, without the risk. The entirety of knowledge. The possibility of doing anything and everything with no barriers or constraints. The built-in ability of supporting someone's growth as fast as they can handle it.  

When people today get mad at social media or phone use, or even measure its negative effects, they're not seeing *the thing*. They're seeing a degradation of the thing that we have to wrestle control from. The addictive dopamine loops are not the essence of it. 
We should be conscious of the upside and weary of the risks. It should be less about policing and more about understanding what specific behaviors and habits we should encourage, in ourselves and in those that have yet to form them. 
It has happened before and will happen again. I have no doubt in our collective ability to adapt and grow.
