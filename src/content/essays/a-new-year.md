## intro

In the great ebb and flow of things, early 2023 was somewhat of a golden age for me: I felt driven, focused, clear-minded and happy. I made good progress in a lot of directions in a short time. 
The latter part, in stark contrast, has been horrendous. I struggle to remember a period of my life I was as depressed. I've deployed the full array of tactics and tricks I thought I'd never see again: fill every single available second with distractions, and above all do not try to sleep until you are about to pass out from exhaustion, to avoid any risk of being alone with your thoughts.  
I never cry, to a fault, but it's been routine lately. 

I'm glad I do. It feels like progress. Like I'm viscerally connecting with things that are wrong with my life, things I have avoided thinking about, things I ought to change. Man is a creature that can get accustomed to anything, they say, and that's usually the issue with it, that's how you die metaphorically. 
In multiple ways, I was at risk of satisfying myself with the mediocre grey, the consistent suboptimal, the constantly incoherent. I pushed myself into it, tried to silence my little inner voice. I could settle, but I don't, I never could, and I won't break. It feels like my depressive state is a result of that tension. My soul is scraping against my daily life, it's screetching like nails on a chalkboard. I'm not learning that helplessness, no thank you. 
I've described myself as tired, exhausted and in need of rest. I think that's backwards: the part of me that wants that is the one who wants to give up. Energy and drive beget energy and drive. I should seek excitement and variance and risks and rewards, not run away from things that excite me. 

What are these problems I ought to fix? I'd say these two are the load bearing ones, let me sketch them. 

## work

Career lore recap: I've done software startup things for 10 years. 

I'm self-conscious about my "track record" when it comes to companies I've founded, worked at, or side projects I've pursued, I'm ashamed of it. I've done a lot of fucking around, with less apparent finding out or getting rewarded for it. I know I'm a maker — I like creating things, having direct ownership, taking risks and getting the appropriate payoffs. I've been in enough situations to know that. I'm giddy just writing this knowing that I'll publish it. 
But /it feels/ like I have fuck-all to show for it. Shouldn't I have built something that's mine by 32? Have I earned the right to call myself that? I've worked on projects doomed to fail with people that should have known better. In brighter days I'd call these learning experiences. These days I just blush in shame and think "this is it, I'll never amount to anything more". 
You know who I really hate? People who call themselves makers and entrepreneurs but actually don't do shit. Really, you shouldn't even have to call yourself that, it's a red flag in itself. 
I hear myself make excuses, the lack in prerequisites, from money, to things I've learned, to the psychology of it, to just the contingency of various fuckups that happened in previous experiences. And I hate that. Never complain, never explain. But it's true. But I hate it. But it's true. But I shouldn't even think about that — I should move on.

These last 3 years, and to an extent the rest of my career, have looked like a fast repeat of the following cycle: => Be broke => Get a job (just for money) => jk! Get increasingly invested => Get frustrated because I can't fix everything and I don't actually have ownership => Quit => Work on something of my own for a while using savings => It doesn't work for various reasons => Be broke =>
The pendulum feels inextricable, even though I've tried various forms of synthesis. I really wanted a job that I could phone in while I worked on other things on the side, nurturing them to self-sufficience, but it didn't work. I've tried finding salaried jobs where I had enough ownership, stakes and responsibility to keep me engaged; no success there either — there is always something wrong, I don't think I'll ever be satisfied with that. 
Right now I'm deep in the middle of the "get frustrated" part. It weighs on me more than it has any right to be. I am physically unable to utter the words "not my problem", everything is and always will be, which is why I need to put myself in situations where it actually is.  

I know a lot of people who left tech to go milk cows on a farm for a living. I don't think that's me, but I do think moving from writing code to product management, which are what these jobs all were, is my equivalent of cutting myself off from touching grass. I'm happier in my projects where I get to make the thing that's in my head from A to Z and enjoy the close feedback loops, instead of handing it off to someone who is going to butcher my vision.

The fix for this is basically to stop trying to fit into something that I'm not. I think I've gathered enough data points about what I like. I need to be more uncompromising, strategize better, be more deliberate in building a worklife I actually enjoy.

## loneliness

I'm really lonely. Really really. Shorted on depth and breadth, I have a few acquaintances. Sometimes I think about getting married with someone. Then I thought about how few people I would invite, and I'm ashamed. 
I'm the "making friends in your 30s" meme but also I was cripplingly shy for most of my 20s so you do the math. I'm not shy anymore, at least I don't think so, I'm pretty competent in taking the social initiative and saying words to humans.. when I need to, I don't do it enough. 

Because I'm depressed I really want to blame myself, find some kind of fatal flaw that makes me unlovable. Realistically, it's just purely contingency. 
Making a social circle when you don't have a social circle is the hardest game. There are a lot of downward feedback loops involved that maintain social isolation: you don't meet new people when you don't know people, you're naturally clingy when you do, your social skills are rusty, etc etc.

Romance is the most painful point of my loneliness. I'm starved of it. I'm desperate for any trace or hint of a connection, so much so that I build any of it up to an absurd degree. There is something I'm fond of in that, an intensity, I'll always be a romantic. There is something I hate. I can't fall in love with every cute girl fluttering her eyelashes in my direction, I can't be ready to give up everything in my life for her after a week / 3 texts. A) It devalues it, I can't have a soulmate every tuesday; B) it's deeply unattractive; C) you'll burn yourself and won't be able to think clearly. 

Because I think it's contingency, it's easy to fix, just break these loops wherever you want. Go talk to people, sign up for a club, go to a jazz club and talk to people —  do whatever, leave the house and translate your ass to the nearest gathering of humans regularly. Why have I not done so? Perhaps it's not all contingency, perhaps I do have social anxiety. Still, that's fixable. 

I have a harder time articulating this one compared to work. I don't really give a fuck about "a career", I don't care that much about being judge for it. I derive a lot of meaning from my work, but I know I'll be alright. I do care about dying alone. I do feel like a loser because I'm lonely. I don't really want to publish that part on the internet.
There is a lot of noise on the line, push and pull. I have to force my brain to think clearly about this. For the longest time I thought myself a lone wolf, that I was fine all this, I'm pretty sure that was a major delusion. I'm sure there are layers of it in play still. We must peel.
