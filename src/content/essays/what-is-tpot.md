As a cold-hearted killjoy, I have set forward the task of cracking the greatest mystery of our time and disenchanting the world by explaining away the enigma that has been on the Bluesky collective mind for what now feels like decades: what is TPOT?

TPOT stands for This Part of Twitter or apparently, according to heretics, This Part of TPOT. Here are a few ways to define what it is:

- From genealogy: big early pillars have emerged as a counter-reaction to rationalists, people who've read their stuff and either rejected their premises, made fun of them, or highlighted the importance of what could not be rationalized away, trying to build on top of their edifice. As anything that touches rationalists, you'll find a [lesswrong post about it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rtM3jFaoQn3eoAiPh/explaining-the-twitter-postrat-scene).  
- As a social cluster: people used to say "ingroup" instead of TPOT, it's a set of people who know each other and tend to know friends of their friends'. This is particularly true since some IRL events have happened and consolidated these clusters of common acquaintances. This is not particularly true since the norms favor openness and a certain lack of gatekeeping. 
- As a set of norms: being part of TPOT means a loose set of common ways of communicating, as dull as liking each others' posts before answering them, to as fundamental as defaulting to charitable interpretations of each others' statements. The worthy if ever unattainable goal is to try to build some cozy niche amidst the constant dumpster fire of dunks and ideological wars. "Illegibility" is also praised, as speaking in riddles is a way to softly select your company.
- As a set of interests: linking back to genealogy, TPOT tends to be interested to think that are not reducible to rationalism, meaning you'll find "vibes" thrown in their posts often, they might talk about things that seem esoteric, or they'll attempt to philosophize and think at the "meta-level" about things that are upstream of the commonly discussed "object-level" things.

Any definition isn't worth much, in fact anyone in TPOT will probably declare themselves TPOT-adjacent instead of anything else. A reflection that you probably shouldn't pay much attention to the definition and just take people at face value for stuff they actually say, and notice who talks to whomst if you're so inclined. Labels as such can only be used to gatekeep from the inside or to demonize from the outside. 

If you're going to use belonging to such group as a heuristics to judge people, it's going to fail. For all of the niceness and embracing of experience, it sometimes feel like half of TPOT has half of TPOT blocked or muted. There is no single ideology or thing that this label stands for. Maybe you'll find things you like and people you enjoy reading in there, but I would advise against
