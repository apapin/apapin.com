As a cold-hearted killjoy, I have set forward the task of cracking the greatest mystery of our time and disenchanting the world by explaining away the enigma that has been on the Bluesky collective mind for what now feels like decades: what is TPOT?

TPOT stands for This Part of Twitter or, according to heretics, This Part of TPOT. Here are a few ways to define what it is:

- **From genealogy**: early pillars have emerged as a counter-reaction to rationalists, people who've read their stuff and either rejected their premises, made fun of them, or highlighted the importance of what could not be rationalized away, to build on top of their edifice. As for anything that touches rationalists, you'll find a rather slanted [lesswrong post about it](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rtM3jFaoQn3eoAiPh/explaining-the-twitter-postrat-scene).


- **As a social cluster**: people used to say "ingroup" instead of TPOT, it's mostly a set of people who know each other or of each other, and tend to know the friends of their friends. This is particularly true since some IRL events have happened and consolidated these clusters of common acquaintances. This is not particularly true since the norms favor openness and a certain lack of gatekeeping. 


- **As a set of norms**: being part of TPOT means a loose set of common ways of communicating, as dull as liking each others' posts before answering them, to as fundamental as defaulting to charitable interpretations of each others' statements. The worthy if ever unattainable goal is to try to build some cozy niche amidst the constant dumpster fire of dunks and ideological wars. "Illegibility" is also praised, as speaking in riddles is a way to softly select your company.


- **As a set of interests**: linking back to genealogy, TPOT tends to be interested in things that are not reducible to rationalism. Meaning you'll find inscrutable "vibes" thrown in their posts often, they might talk about things that seem esoteric, or they'll attempt to philosophize and think at the "meta-level" about things that are upstream of the commonly discussed "object-level" things, such as politics. That also ties in nicely with general politeness and lack of partisanship. 

Any definition isn't worth much, in fact anyone in TPOT will probably declare themselves TPOT-adjacent instead of anything else. If someone is telling you they are representing TPOT, they probably aren't. Even my attempt at a description isn't probably that good, I'll leave it to future internet historians. It's a reflection that you probably shouldn't pay much attention to the definition and just take people at face value for stuff they actually say, and notice who talks to whomst if you're so inclined. The label is only useful to gatekeep from the inside, by deciding who is in and who is out, or to demonize from the outside, by painting a simplified enemy. 

If you're going to use belonging to TPOT as a heuristic to judge people, it's going to fail. For all of the niceness and embracing of experience, it sometimes feels like half of TPOT has half of TPOT blocked or muted. There is no single ideology or thing that this label stands for. Maybe you'll find things you like and people you enjoy reading in there, but I would advise against using that label to drive any of your life decisions on your social platform of choice.

Get out there, get to know people, judge them from what they say, engage with what you like or fight  what you don't, follow the social links to find more people you like, but please stop asking "what is TPOT?".
