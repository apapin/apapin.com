Tesler's law is a software interface principle that states the following:

> For any system, there is a certain amount of complexity that cannot be reduced.

This is usually a warning for any designer trying to oversimplify an interface, particularly in the context of potent and versatile tools.

Let's say you're making software, like a calendar app. Let's say you want it to cover the needs of basically anyone, any workflow anyone might ever use to organize their time. So you get to it and add more and more customization features.
How easy to use can you make the end product? Are you sure someone wouldn't be better off learning how to code and build their perfect calendar app themselves instead of learning how to operate your 200 setting screens?

Sometimes there is no decrease in complexity; you're just moving it around. Shifting who gets to deal with the spiky parts.
This is comparable to a lot of the skepticism around AI right now.
Consider [this tweet and the general sentiment](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt/status/1631866199515738113)

The underlying belief is that all of these promises were lies and didn't change anything, which is false. The projected idea is that if you want an AI to create a complex app tomorrow, you'll have to write a Tolsto√Ø-level novel, so you might as well write code.

This is the same reductionism low-level programmers apply to high-level programmers or programmers apply to managers.

I don't know what the articulation is precisely, but this is a misunderstanding of the associated tradeoffs with you jumping up a level of abstraction. You give more powerful tools and leverage to more people, at the cost of control. There isn't anyone being invalidated here; just different means that are better or worse at achieving different ends.

A certain amount of complexity won't go anywhere, but many things will undoubtedly become easier than you're used to. It'd be equally lying to pretend nothing will change or to peddle miracle pills.
