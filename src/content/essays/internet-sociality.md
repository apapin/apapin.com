The recent exodus from one peculiar part of Twitter to Blue Sky has made me realize that I definitely am not interested by social networks for the same reasons others might be.

So I thought I'd attempt to list reasons why I spent so much time on the internet getting to know people, and why I think it's so special. 

## Scale
The first factor is scale. Scale means that any arbitrary specific niche can exist, freed from the bounding factor of geography. In real life, you settle down, your choices of friendships are made by default by access restrictions. On the internet, you can set whatever level of commonality you want, and you'll be able to find people and communities sharing it. 

This makes marginalized groups suddenly have a place they can call home, and allows you to find the one precise community you have the most commonalities with. You have might have friends by default in real life, but you shouldn't here. 


## Level playing field
The second factor is pseudonimity. There is something liberating for yourself in hiding behind a mask, but it's not what I mean. I'm more interested in the effect it has on others: it forces them to judge you only by what you say, instead of judging you for who you are. It's innately emancipatory. 
Among things this bypass are judging people by their gender, skin color, or general appearance; but the list goes on.

This bleeds outside of anonymous or pseudonymous contexts. The general ethos is one of a level field, where celebrities interact with derpderp2984 outside of the usual power norms. 

Some platforms are better or worse at this, and have userbase that are more or less acquired to the cause.  Of course, social dynamics and status games are never too far, but people using the same heuristics they do in real life in the virtual web are missing out on opportunities to connect. 

## Communication norms
A few of the characteristics of communicating on the internet have the same benefit. They make it easier and less intimidating to communicate and disclose things. Places on the internet, for example, can have one or more of these: 

- Asynchronicity: you are not waiting for an immediate answer
- 1:n: you are not talking to someone in particular but shouting to the wind.
- Writing over talking: you can draft, edit and craft before hitting send.

In general, how you communicate on the internet has less friction for certain personality types, but I think it also generally promotoes certain behaviors. You can build intimacy with someone, including weird mono-sided relationships, faster on the internet than in real life, if the conditions are right. 

## The commons
People do things in public on the internet more than they do in the real world. A good part of the interactions are still relegated to group chats or DMs, but there are always pathways to get into communities that are more visible and discoverable than in real life. 

It synergizes with the level playing field: not only are people not judging you as dismissively, but there is nobody at the gate to do it in the first place. 

The whole thing allows for interactions that would never have happened there. Internet is market making, liquidity, a great connector, and the removal of barriers we have in real life. At a fundamental level, it decreases wasted opportunities and potential.
