The prevailing notion since the enlightenment is that we're better off knowing things. "Sapere aude" Kant told us, "dare to know things through reason." The link is that knowing means emancipation, that you gain control over something by understanding its mechanisms, and that this will make us all better off. It's the same underlying Freud had: if you understood your traumas and how they constrain your actions, you'd be free(er) of their influence.

That idea is reinforced in all the intellectual types that pride themselves in their capacity to think. If you like pondering deep concepts and learning new things, you're close to thinking it's the universal remedy to every problem. The application of a sufficient amount of books will deal with anything.
I'm definitely in that camp.

Here are the blinkers I'm talking about:

> a pair of small leather screens attached to a horse's bridle to prevent it seeing sideways and behind and being startled.

A lot of time, I'd be better off if I had blinkers on and was aware of fewer things. I'd certainly be less constantly startled and live a more peaceful life. I would do more stuff without perpetually thinking about reasons not to try, or imagining worst-case scenarios.

The value of knowing less is neatly demonstrated by the sometimes surprising success of whoever doesn't know better. Knowing shit-all about a subject might for example, lead you to appear all-confident, a trait that's commonly valued, including by people who really should know better. By being an amateur and not knowing how things might go wrong, you sometimes stumble into a fresh, novel idea that was dismissed decades ago but might be suitable for today. You can imagine the IQ curve meme here as well.

There are many reasons not to do things, and valuing thinking and knowledge will lead you to find them. Classic ways of shooting yourself in the foot by knowing too much may include:

- constantly overthinking what other people think or how you may be socially judged for your actions;
- finding excuses by thinking about how "the environment" or "society" works and how it makes it unfair for you;
- thinking that there is no way someone else hasn't already done it since it's obvious to you, so why would you bother?
- reading too much formulaic advice that other people have written instead of doing and learning for yourself;

Being ignorant is a dangerous game, and I would not advise lobotomy as a way to get ahead in life. But really, most of the things we think we know are hallucinations, conceptual blockers, that you could be better off by trying to dispense of for a while.
