the company was founded with a mission. a compelling, cute, and perennial one. a wave of hype around a new tech had just made everyone reconsider what was possible, but the fields to which it could be applied were always the same. this time it was a word cloud: human flourishing, connecting people, bringing them together. the founders were not exactly of the decisive visionary type, they didn't paint a clear picture of what they were going to do. but they had a great track record, so vague gesturing was enough to get significant investments. 

one of the founders had more convictions than that. "it was a shameful waste", he thought. a lot of lonely people on Earth: they only needed each other. his engineer-brain couldn't bear it. slack in the machine, perfect unions prevented from being by inefficiencies, coincidences, and the unfortunate hand of fate. too tempting a thing to engineer! like someone looking at a map in the 1840s and wondering why nobody had built the Suez canal yet. humanity had a problem to solve. 
  
it all spoke to techno-optimists well. it was a comforting way of thinking about it: there was a loneliness problem and you only had to grasp for the cure, right there. tech shall prevail once more as it had many more times before. they had no trouble convincing people, soon data scientists flocked to them. 
  
the prototype's object was modeling people. a fairly standard idea: take two profiles, and calculate a compatibility score. there was some debate as to what they should aim to maximize - the median, the mean, the exceptionally high compatibles - and the various tradeoffs involved, but not too much doubt about the overarching concept. 

they built profiles of people with an increasing sophistication, from an increasing number of data sources people were all too happy to give them access to. implants of all sorts were getting popular, the data was getting deeper. each week a few dozen new dimensions appeared on the board. they weren't na√Øve enough to let the computers do all the work, that had been the sentiment in the previous wave. now they added human expertise here and there. controlled experiments in sterile environments to adjust the vast inscrutable matrices. feedback loops in a few places to make sure the models would converge. 

the only issue was: it didn't work. well, not completely. of course, they had some success stories. cool little anecdotes that warmed their hearts: platonic BFFs, projects launched together, and a few weddings. enough that the general public might be fooled into thinking they were on course, with some smart PR cobbling it all together. but they knew better. hidden in shame was data showing that two people randomly running into each other at an event only had marginally worse prospects for a relationship than people that had met on the app, after all that number crunching of their selves and computing power had deemed them a match. 

meetings grew increasingly stressful. the first people to dissent were right, but also widely seen as ruining the mood. their protests wouldn't lead to much. and then a switch: panic! "it's so over", everyone would say at the water cooler. the conditions were met for true corporate transformation. a prophet-in-exile of an employee suddenly came back with a fancy new title. he had ideas that were slightly off from everyone else's since the beginning, and everyone else had grown sufficiently desperate to give them a shot. 

simple insights they were, and yet incredibly potent. the first, deconstructive: trying to build profiles of someone wasn't that useful. the data mostly hinted at the dead weight. things they had done, superficial interests. hinted at below: socio-economical background, intelligence... those were all fine and dandy but not that effective. he wanted not to match two people-in-being, but two people-in-potential. the idea: we are all nodes in a social tapestry, grasping to find the ones that can make us what we want to be, and bring out the best in us. in precious few cases, we are pulling in the same direction. he wanted to remove the compatibility score and replace it with a story. a story of what two people might be to each other and through each other, a story of what could be.

the compatibility score failed because it could never account for the multiplicity of these stories, the many facets people could have. as they built new tools and frameworks to work under that new paradigm, they discovered that the old one only had tenuously approached the truth. but now they had a way to describe it in all its richness. aspirations and dreams, what was and what could be. the app evolved to get that out of someone and into the plainest of descriptions. it was matching ideals that had yet to pass, and describing a road to get there together. 

the second insight, constructive: the old product paradigm was deeming two people compatible and throwing them at each other. "go ahead kiddos, now do the thing" was the user experience. anything more was seen as paternalizing or out-of-scope. but it didn't sit well with the new team. 

relationships are repeated small acts of trust, a slow building of intimacy, and an eventual understanding that didn't need to be explicit and wordy. the paragonal relationship involved sending "smooch" every few weeks with no context and it being enough. 

the expectations of the app collided with that: you could not reach the peaceful state with all the burden of having been deemed perfectly compatible with each other. too much, too quickly. it was a self-defeating prophecy. they would need to help people along. something to ease into. the first breakthrough was a fancy bit of neuroscience combined with a brand new implant that had gone popular: you'd get a notification each time someone was thinking about you.

at first, designers were concerned. it seemed like a dark pattern. in the field, it turned out much better. something magical always happened: the frequencies of mutual thinking always converged. it had a soothing effect on people. insecurity ruled the world: is she thinking about me as much as I do? am I in his head if he isn't messaging me? now it all got dispelled, with absolutely stellar results. relationships were calmer and quicker to access their heights. the progressive disclosure, the joys of flirting, the litany of masks: all still there, just better. 

in a few decades, much was learned about this. the notifications got more elaborate and adapted themselves to the nature of the relationship and the people evolved. the product team was hard at work to make it gentler, less invasive, and aware of how the relationships unfolded. 

in 50 years, the app was so ubiquitous that it might as well have been part of nature. you didn't really "use" it, per se. it didn't throw a match at you, you didn't have to prompt it with stories of who you'd like to be. it was just there, a little serendipity machine, gently correcting course and helping people along, not forcing them into a path. 

in centuries, it had brought billions of people together. the consequences were greater than anyone had imagined, bigger than anyone could tell even then. from small acts of brotherly love to lifelong partners building their nests, to entire revolutions led by artists and scientists who could not have been what they were, had they not been supported by a network of friends they'd never have found before. 

it took a while, but they had figured out what mattered.
