Nothing quite compares to reading some evocative piece of writing, and it elicits powerful and forgotten sensations.

I recently read this analytic philosophy article attempting to debunk common reasons defending the fact being vague in dialogue might be good. I take this vaguely personally and to be very wrong. There are a few angles I've thought of but there is one in particular I want to write about.

I think the big argument is one of finding other humans and relating to each other. Moments of real connection require making it through the fog. Finding a partner is finding a soul that has somehow ended up in the same place as you after decades of wandering and meandering. In this, meaning is ascribed by rarity. It's the same when you convey meaning. Valuable things are hard to describe, it's a small miracle when you manage to get them through to anyone, and that's what makes it good. Conversely, plain and obvious don't bestow any value.

It's particularly true in writing, creative writing in particular. I like nothing more than when the words pull me in inside the screen, push me through 93 abstraction and semantic layers, and straight up in the author's mind. There are 93 layers because you need 93 to get there. Not because you're being cute. A worse writer probably would have used 184. A reader in the wrong place won't make it through.

I think it's why I like Twitter and similar social networks too. Or at least parts of it with certain communication norms. You stumble upon someone new, have a few interactions, and then end up looking at their profile. And so the process begins. You get 100s or 1000s samples of neat little pockets of thought they've done their best to write up. Now, how many non-trivial ones will you grok?
Maybe 20? We're starting to cook. 50? Maybe there is a potential friendship in there. 500, 1000? Let's get married right now. There is a dangerous illusion of intimacy in there, but at the same time, you're speedrunning knowledge that would probably take you years to build up the old, perfectly legible, fashioned way.

1-to-many communication is impersonal, but it somehow makes it more powerful here. Someone isn't trying to placate you on their feed like they might in DMs or in a conversation. They are not carefully crafting things so that they speak to you. They are trotting along at their own pace, playing their own games, and thinking about it aloud. When it happens to perfectly latch to yours and resonate, it only makes it stronger.

Replies are a test of this too. Good reply games is going up, taking a step forward and announcing that you get it. And then you'll learn fast if you do. Looking through replies or comments is constant twinges of sorrow as you watch people not getting it and failing the connection. Maybe not at all, or maybe they get stuck at layer number 54 out of 93, so close and yet so far. Maybe it's your turn not getting it at all.

I don't like it when people are voluntarily illegible and it's a performative thing. I think it can be exploitative. A lot of posters have made a career out of being ambiguous enough to be interpreted as possibly anything, and popularity-maxxing that way. Maybe Nietzsche was the original one, almost accidentally, piling one aphorism after another. Regardless, there is no need to be fake about it.

Being you and respecting the world in its complexity is enough. Sensations and memories are fuzzy and messy. Authentic people are not simple or reducible, nor should you wish that they be. And diaries in the open give us a unique way to demonstrate that and create true deep by default connexions with people who might read them.
