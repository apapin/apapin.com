### concordance 
 
I remember getting invited to the birthday party of a girl i liked late in high school. I remember how she looked that day, how cute in her costume. Her saying hi to me. I remember nothing else. I fled the scene, left early. I didn't try anything, didn't say anything. Years passed by and not a single word was said.  
  
A few years later, I remember hanging out with two females friends. One prods me to give a compliment about how good looking and dressed up the other one is. They exchange knowing looks. I crack a joke to deflect, make some passing remark. The moment dies. I only understand what was expected of me later on.  
  
Another few years later, I met a girl on the internet. After a few months of exchanging affection over voice calls, I traveled to the other side of the country for work, she happened to be there. We didn't know what we looked like or each other's last names. We met up, had dinner. It went well, I thought. On our second date, she suddenly started crying. I held her in my arms, confused. She had thought I didn't like her because I didn't make moves on our first date, felt like she had failed. I did my best to dispel that impression during the rest of my trip.  
  
It left me quite a mark. I think it's when I became truly resolute never to let an to opportunity pass by, to always be clear, to take take initiatives. I was indebted to her. I owed it to the world, and to myself. It didn't get through to me before, even when it was clearly deleterious. but holding her in my arms like that, realizing I had let her down and hurt her by keeping my feelings and dispositions towards her to myself, it made me commit to always being forward with them.  
  
These memories are more than a decade old now. I've grown a lot since then, accumulated experience, have been weathered by events. By many metrics I'm still a shy, awkward nerd, but I've also been called charismatic too many times to count. Meeting new people doesn't come easily, but taking first steps does. I have my moments, my flashes of brillance, in the right situations.  
By many metrics avoidance still rules my world. I feel everything so strongly I would rather not. I spend weeks withering away in hiding instead of living my life, talking to people, trying new things, shaking up my routines. But I have my moments of courage, I take chances, I throw away caution. Unequal displays of recklessness.  

I enjoy being assertive, I enjoy taking first steps and risks, I enjoy taking the lead and being relied upon. But I'm too sensitive for it. I feel a lot and very fast. These are not compatible stances, a wallflower is so because she couldn't bear being the center of attention and the risks that come with it, the man full of bravado is so because he doesn't care, doesn't feel anything, hasn't known failure, or is otherwise immune to the consequences. 

Neuroscience has this thing called "Eysenck's arousal hypothesis", which is him linking the activity of a certain part of the brain with whether people are introverted or extroverted. High baseline levels of activity in the ascending reticular activating system (i really enjoy that name, try repeating it really fast), the thing that acts as a controller on how awake you are, more or less, means you're introverted. You're avoiding further stimulation by keeping to yourself, because your levels are already dangerously high. Extroverts have low base levels, and are relying on interacting with others constantly to raise it. 

Less than a scientific theory of truth, I enjoy the metaphor. When I'm *too social*, that is to say, social at all, I feel like I'm overheating, I'm crossing some barrier that I was not designed to cross. My realm is a rich inner life, a cup of tea and the comforts of home, alone. 
But I'm lonely, deeply lonely. I'm too much of a romantic to interact with the fairer sex; too much of an idealist to maintain friendships for long. I think good things are easy, just hard to find. I'm prepared to die alone if that's what it means, but this isn't even the line of thought I'm going with. It's not a sacrifice, it's just the way things are, it's what I do. You have to stand for some things. 

The fight is between feeling or acting numb. It's about letting the heart speak, or avoidance & repression.

### impact

Two weeks ago I met a girl. Not met met, met online. I wonder sometimes if that's not the first root of avoidance. I've known of her but only from afar, we hadn't interacted much. She reached out because she has read a longform post I wrote about falling in love too hard and too fast (or as i call it on occasion, the right way). She wanted to thank me for the public candor she found inspirational. I was glad, the whole point of publishing them is to find opportunities for connection. I responded in kind. 

We soon started talking about our common orientation towards love and feelings. How we both yearned to be able to be our fully intense sensitive selves. How rare it was to find the conditions for it, and how rare it seemed to find the same intensity of feelings in others. 

It was an ominous first topic to connect on. I could have written the rest of the story then, before it happened. It's a little bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy for sure, but it also felt fated. We branched out in topics, for fear that talking about love might generate an artificial sense of intimacy. It didn't really help. 

Our exchanges soon felt electric. We started sending each other long letters. I was looking forward to each and every one of hers, and spent long hours crafting my responses with care, in the liminal space between choosing my words carefully and wanting to get back to her immediately to get more of her. In the few days after our first contact, we had filled a dozen pages. 

Even right now there are a dozen topics that I want to talk to her about. Things we said in passing that made me realize we have something in common that I want to talk about. Threads to pull on. I ended up keeping a list of them, now in fallow. 
Somewhere along in our conversations I scribbled in my notes "she is me from another life trajectory". It's easy to learn from others when you feel that way. 
I think we have the same basis of personality in ways I can't quite articulate, and then divergences in small interesting ways brought upon by our life experiences. This makes for compelling discovery of the other. I could finish her sentences and anticipate her reactions, get what she meant and her point, even with just a few hints. She made points I could have made in similar ways, sometimes better, and cared about things I cared about.

I'm no stranger to catching feelings hard and fast, sometimes at shadows. But that felt pure â€” like we're sister souls, seemingly cut from the same cloth, 1 in 10,000 in likeness and compatibility. Not purely romantic, in fact. 
It felt good to be seen by her from the very start when she reached out about my writing, it felt good to see her for who she was and her deep qualities. The things we had in common went from music taste to board games to little idiosyncrasies to how we wrote. 
But again, none of these really are what I mean. I don't know if they're even parts of it, it's too hard to describe. Something across a super-MBTI/astrology or something of the sort. A taxonomy could have a 1,000 slots and we'd probably be in the same one. Values, interests, ways of seeing the world. 

Within days, the encounter made me reconsider a few things. It reminded me of how high chemistry can go, how much you can want to know someone better. My previous limerence felt hollow. There was the feelings but not the connection. Here it felt like I had known her for years or a decade. We didn't need to contextualize everything we told each other, we got it. I never knew my previous crush enough in weeks of interactions, she was too guarded for it, not interested in earnestness or the unencumbered ways of the heart. Here I was having both in just a few days. 
I had gone on a few dates with someone else in the previous weeks, I ended up breaking it off for similar reasons, it did not compare favourably. High highs make all the rest go gray.

The chemistry and pull we felt gently slided and the words soon turned affectionate, interlaced with all the heart emojis in the book. That speed and intensity of infatuation we had related on initially was there. Somewhere during that week, we said something that amounted, with a decent level of indirection, thin veils and plausible deniability, that we kept each other up at night. 
Never so fast so true. What we had is what I call a mutually assured delusion. No lies were spoken, but I think we both knew what was going on, how fast the winds could turn. We deeply cared for each other and had found our sudden irruption into each other's lives delightful, but we were under no illusion that it'd still be there in a month.
Our first words spoken to each other were about our idealistic romantic personalities. We knew what to expect. It did not make us any less intense, any more jaded. This is, ball park, the kind of attitude I'd like to keep bringing to my romantic ventures. I enjoyed it for what it was, a sweet infatuation, with the innocence and power of a teen holiday hook-up, but as a grown-up 30y old man. 

She sent me a video of her responding to one of my messages, and it had me giggling the whole way through watching it. I got some weird looks in the streets, as if a madman. I wanted to shout the feelings I was starting to feel off the rooftops. 
The ugly parts reared their heads too, I started feeling jealousy, and anxiety at the fragile and nascent bond that held us together. 
It felt real. Too real, therefore scary. I wrote this in my journal:

> I think i'm hoping that she finds someone else. hoping that this peters out. hoping that we aren't exactly being our "fully intense selves" that we were talking about. it's an intense burden. so much pressure. can i handle that? do I want to discover what's behind and risk anihilation? it'd be much easier if it collapsed now. the path is the scary one.

My inner movie making machine was also once more working over time. I was imagining best case scenarios where we met and our written early chemistry was as strong there as it was here. Taking a plane right now and go meet her. What stopped you? I could write the script easily. Again, same idea here. I hold my fantasies dearly, thinking about them is how I make them real. They were that, moonshots, I realized how far away they were, how unlikely and treacherous the path to get there was. 

The first strike came a week after we met. She'd be busy for the week-end, with not much opportunities to write to me with the same regularity we had grown accustomed to. I told her not to worry, that I'd be there when she came back. I regretted saying that instantly. I was the one to worry. 
She took just an imperceptive amount of distance and time off, then came back to say her enthusiasm has diminished, and she didn't find compelled to write back the long messages we had gotten ourselves into. 
Of course, I already knew, she didn't really need to say it. We still had that telepathic-wavelength thing going, that common way of seeing the world. Unfortunate that it now served for me to watch that thing derail with painfully accurate perception of how she felt. Is it anxious attachment when you're right? Probably yes. In my mind, it was worse than it actually was. I felt my feelings diminishing as she pulled back, a good old self-defense mechanism readying me for what might come next. We had been in a self-reinforcing loop of reciprocation, now it had turned the other way around. 

In reaction, I thought it'd be a good idea to schedule a video call, partly I think because she told me it was a good way for her to gauge chemistry, and she had told me how important it was for a previous romantic interest of hers. 
I, for one, think video calls are a terrible way to gauge that, and this one would be just casual chitchatting with no support or guide or something concrete to talk about. Probably could be an actual nightmare of mine. Transitioning from long heartfelt letters to this would be like jumping into cold water after a sauna, but bad. And I had all that weight of expectations that I put myself under, plus the first sign that something had gone wrong, that she got some ick. 

The moment I needed that bravado I have worked so hard for was the moment it was already lost. Was the lesson not the right one? It's not, my risk taking is not in the bravado or the assertiveness, the sense of initiative. It's part of it, but not the main one. It's first and foremost about opening yourself up, allowing yourself to feel the full range of your feelings, and thereby allowing the possibility of a crash and burn, because that's the only way to allow for the possibility of glory and happily ever after. Now was the time for that crash. 

The pullback struck my confidence pretty hard, and put me in a position I knew I could not come back from, because I'd now be radiating insecurity and worry and anxiety and awkwardness, instead of being the charming and jaunty self I can be otherwise. 

The call went about as badly as it could have gone, it felt like the kind of worst case scenario that you'd come up with because of anxiety but that would never happen, and it buried any potential for romance. 

### cleanup

She tried to put words on why, which never goes well in my experience. The reasons the spark is gone are not legible, and whether you're trying to interrogate someone for why they won't love you, or trying to make someone feel better by coming up with a rational description, it's never satisfying.

It could have been me doing a u-turn on our affections. In fact I did that just before with someone else I had started seeing before she came into my life. Powerful feelings are fickle, who knows what lies beyond them? They should not constitute promise or future obligations, and I did not. No matter, it didn't make it any less painful.  

I was already in a bad mood for ~general reasons~, and that episode  sent me quite down the rabbit hole, with some particularly gloomy thoughts. That mad dash, the burning of a candle, which I knew I'd look back fondly on one day, still left me reeling. 

In the instant of her rejection, I felt a rush of inadequacy, I felt sharply everything I wish was going better in my life. All the little things I haven't done, all the moments spent avoiding. I see all the things I didn't give proper care to, all the things I left drifting in the last few months and years into a state of deep dissatisfaction. The clarity is binding.

I feel shame. Shame that I didn't hold up. To her, to the moment, to the feelings. Shame that I was awkward, shame that I ruined it. I don't want to write and publish this. I don't want the world to know that *I* turned her feelings into ashes. 

I wanted to be of service to her, to make her smile, to support her, to be her knight and to protect her from all the bad in the world. For our mutual yearning so close in kind to be fulfilled by one another. But I could not. 

This isn't how anything works. It's not really about your worth or personal failings. There is no hierarchy. But that's what I felt, incredibly sharply, incredibly painfully. I was inadequate. 

I could think of dozens of things I could have done differently, things I could have said or ways I could have looked or decisions I could have made. But I wasn't good enough; and I'm left with whising things were slightly different, and waiting for the next time life will throw me another of these occasions to fumble. It might never come, says the little voice. You will ruin it again, it says. 

What hurts the most is that my words used to have an effect on her. I could make her happy. I told her I wanted to protect her, to help her fulfill her world-ranging ambitions, to be her partner.. I know she felt it, then. 
Saying it now would feel hollow. Not on my part, I still feel it, just slightly tuned down by rejection . But I know the words would have no effect.

All of it was made worse by the fact that I felt so close to her in terms of personality and behaviors.  The fact that she was "me from another life trajectory" meant all the little things she was faring better on were painfully obvious.
In the beginning I found solace in the fact that we had the same problems, the same areas of self-work we struggled with, and I had found a companion for these. 
Comparison is the thief of joy they say, well at that point I didn't have any to spare, so go ahead and look for it all you want. 

The things bothering me the most about the state of my life were the ones she is visibly best at. I adored her for them, as for many other things. I envied her circle of friendships, the social support she had around her. She had a grace I do not yet have in these matters. I still act as if I'm a lone wolf, an introvert not in need of anyone, when I have quite clearly discovered that it's wrong.
I envied her agency, the ambition and sheer willpower I once had in me but feels quieter in recent times. Repressed or used up and in need of recharge. 
  
My social lacks are not just a problem-in-itself, but also a root. My growth is prompted by others. I need to hold a girl sobbing in my arms for me to fix my issues, including when they're about avoiding others because i feel too much.  My lack of growth in reaching out for others, my lack of care to build and maintain a circle of confidents & friends. 

Days passed, and then I didn't feel inadequacy. I felt a crushing weight instead â€” how how did I get here, how do I get out? 

And then I feel elation, mania. The energy of potentialities and paths to come.

Once again, I'm reminded: I'm perfectly content in my isolation, but I still need to see the smile I produce on someone's face to make my life complete. A special someone. The goal is worth the path. 

### dawn

When you're young, you don't really realize how rare these moments of deep connection are. The first few you fumble feel inconsequential. Cue ravings about abundance mindset. The truth is, they're quite scarce. I like to think I'm particularly picky, an outlier in a lot of ways, alien to the norms, a few standard deviation off; surely that doesn't help, but I don't think it's easy for anyone who isn't willing to settle down.  And I'm not. 

I like to make fun of these calculators that keep coming up in the dating discourse, where you input a certain level of income, a certain height, a certain whatever, and it tries to depress you by telling you how rare that combination you're looking for in a partner is. It doesn't work for me. I don't think people who think these matter at all realize how strong selection effects are. You control where you meet people: where you live, what your social circles are, what you spend your time doing. It's incredibly trivial to 1000x the occurrence of certain combinations of these traits by acting in some ways. 
It doesn't even have to be machiavellian or instrumental, I'm not telling incels to take bachata lessons, it's just a product of leaning into things you are comfortable with, and living your life deliberately. We aren't particles randomly colliding in the void, we have agency. 

It was hard to remember for me, in that lower mood. What I have no clue about how to do is trying to find that type of connections. There is nothing external facing that could have told me it would go like that. I didn't take the first step, because I didn't know. 
It depressed me even though it actually worked as designed. We met on a part of the internet I was deliberately hanging around in because I know it to be full of people that are significantly closer to me than the general population, where I have found interesting conversations and good connections. 
On top of that, the best way I have found to meet like-minded people is just doing an open-air diary on the internet and see who stumbles upon it, and she did, and answered the call and reached out. Writing in public and in earnestness is a convoluted search query for people like you.
But this is agonisingly passive for my taste. Surely I can do better. That thing we had is still incredibly rare, it feels like I could wait a century to get another one. I guess the agentic part of this would be growing an audience and the serendipity attack surface, but these are not particularly desirable to me. 

The depressing general idea that gets me in these moments is always the same. It's a fight between the fated and the temporal, an ideal world of forms and the actual one we're dealing with over here. Soulmates meeting at the wrong time, fated lovers shooting themselves in the foot and ruining a perfect union. 
You can find this one in a million person with which you could have stronger bonds than anyone else, and fuck it up all the same. It's always a little your fault and a little of theirs. 
I always think of what I can control and what I could have done differently as a matter of policy. That's how you get better. I don't have regrets, but I have questions. And I'm despairing a little about how I wish everything was slightly different. 

Maybe you're out of shape. Maybe you are going through a rough patch. Maybe you didn't have your coffee that morning and you said something dumb that left a bad impression. Maybe you are on a dating app but don't look good on pictures. Maybe you're so in love so fast and so hard that you're reduced to a babbling awkward mess. Maybe maybe maybe.
I'm a romantic but not an idiot â€” the real world wins. Good people get icky, true opportunities are wasted, relationships are made for the wrong reasons. Caring is not always rewarded, real compatibility isn't either. Charismatic sociopaths win, me and others are slave to bad desires and impulses. 
I got reminded recently that I can be particularly attracted to a certain brand of getting stepped on and badly treated. These are not traits I'm looking for someone to be a long term partner and to build a family with. It doesn't matter. 

In the end, when everything is said and done, it all comes back to exposure therapy. I have calibrated my richter scale for chemistry and attraction, I know the true heights I can reach in terms of instant feeling of understanding and connection. I have been reminded of all the cool people that are out there, and of the qualities and values I hold dear in them. I have made tactical mistakes that will inform my future decisions, and have made me more aware of how the world and I work, refining my model a little. I have acquired cherishable memories of being in a constant ðŸ¥° state, of what it feels like, of what I want to be to someone else, in their eyes and them in mine. 

There is no conclusion, but there will be another post in my romantic saga.
