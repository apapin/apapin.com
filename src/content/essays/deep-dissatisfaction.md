A boiling frog of a life. You had nice things going, once. And then little by little everything eroded. People came and went. Occupations. It all turned bad little by little, while you were not paying attention.
You dream of glorious acts. Sweet stories. Heroic interventions. The daily slips through unnoticed. And then you suddenly realize it, all at once. Weeks of alternating between anxiety and sadness. You were not OK. A deep dissatisfaction is around you, turns out nothing in your life is going well. Friendships, love, career, hobbies. There is no grounding. The one thing your feelings and your objective self seem to agree on is that no one would miss you should you run away. You're alienated from it all. You have no purpose, no cause to be a part of.

There is a slow sinking feeling of isolation. A barrier around you. Anhedonia but not only. Everything seems not worth it. Not today, you say, but tomorrow. Knowing what you need to do, but not doing it all the same. The lack of energy. You don't want to spend time looking. You don't want to spend time getting rejected until you find the right thing. You don't see anyone you can relate with, the few times you try you get burned badly. You think you are extended a lifeline, then by the time you're convinced of it, it disappears — another illusion. Nothing can realistically save you from the depths you've put yourself into, so everything will disappoint.

Nobody is ever unscathed, but you think you can't handle the next failure. You think you'd melt and disappear. So you don't risk it. You retreat and choose to do nothing. You'd tie yourself to the mast if you could, at least you'd have an excuse. Your rational self is yelling at you for taking the worst course of action.
To be able to solve it and become your happy self again, you'd need to be your happy self. You are not. You don't see how you could be again. Waiting? Maybe your neurotransmitters will change of their own volition. Best you can imagine right now. Just wait. A year, a decade or a lifetime ought to do it.

The quest for distractions. You do anything except anything that might solve your problems, change your environment sufficiently to give you a new grasp on your life. Everything but thinking about your state. Looking at feeds. Entertaining delusions. Enjoying destructive pleasures. The more you try the more your real feelings manage to seep through. Soon you are brought to tears by the trivial. A catastrophe is looming.

Comparing yourself. Feeling envious. Why are others getting what you want? This is a feeling you thought you left behind, but now jealousy rules your day. You see the world with the lens of your own insecurities.
Yelling at the world. Blaming everything but yourself. Why did you get put here? Why you? Why is the world so unfair? Is there no justice? Again — stupid thoughts that make no sense, you knew it just a few months ago.
Then switching entirely. It's all your fault. Your destiny is yours to control, so you're the one who fucked up. Case in point, you could still solve it, and you aren't doing anything. It's clearly your fault.

You are depressed under the summer sun. What right do you have? By all objective metrics you should be content. There isn't anything bad happening to you. But you have dreams of ideals and high standards. Your reality is nothing but. You know there is more. You've been there. You see it. Around you and in others. But you can't reach for it.
