he had met a girl. he had fallen for her harder than he had fallen for anyone before. in his head, many alarm bells were ringing. they had had pleasant interactions, he could feel a mutual pull, gentle nudges towards the notion that it wasn't all made up in his head. but he could also feel his unbridled enthusiasm and optimism turn him into a babbling idiot, the most unattractive of all obsequious messes. visions of a future so perfect they reverbed back in time and turned his brain into mush.

he was always the self-confident one, projecting a calming aura of reassuring dad energy around him, but in this venture, he might as well have been his teenage self. he felt silly. he didn't want her to see him like that. he had very little feeling of inadequacy and need for validation, but his uncontrolled want for more would most likely pass for that. he had worked to learn to express his feelings instead of repressing them, but now they came bursting through with collateral damage.

he had this impulse towards totality, when he liked someone that much he wanted nothing more than spend all his time with them, an immediate absorption of all concerns: do more right now. his friends explained it to him in terms of attachment theory, but he did not care.
still, it was a self-destructive prophecy for sure. he knew these things took time, repeated small acts for which he had to build patience. he needed to be at peace with relationships for what they were right now, not try to speedrun through steps. it wasn't so bad if they were to flirt in candlelit alcoves until the end of time, after all. he enjoyed it. what's the rush?

she felt his inner turmoil. it wasn't hard for her, he thought, seeing as emotionally mature as she was. she always got him exactly, and always had the right words. she suggested they used this new app: it would employ fancy new neuroscience to notice when you were thinking about someone and notify them. sometimes it'd be just that, sometimes there would be a little bit of context attached to it: what made you think about them, some general sense of a feeling. it didn't just verbalize it and made it cold: it felt more like a mood board, a gentle patchwork of evocation.

he was skeptical at first. what if she didn't like that he was thinking about her so much? what if the imbalance in how much they were thinking about each other ruined it? it was the sort of thoughts you knew were dumb as soon as you had them, but couldn't shake off.

shaked off they were after a few weeks of use: it just felt so right.

a gentle notification of her thoughts calmed him down and had him serene and daydreaming for hours. he had found it hard to focus on his work since he met her. she inspired him to be his best self, and he had a renewed creativity and drive, but he was also full of worry and doubt and overintellectualizing. the notifications cut through that fog.

in his mind, he imagined the two of them lying in bed together, their hands extended towards each other, but merely hovering, inches away. he could feel her warmth but not her touch. it was reassuring, calming. promising, but not overwhelming. an ambient niceness, an understanding that did not need words or explicit actions. it's how he felt when he read her writing too. it was a gentle way to build intimacy without burden or pressure., an outlet for his unbounded enthusiasm.

it's a complicated task in a relationship to build a sense of intimacy without ruining the magic.
on one side there is the impulse to merge, to remove all boundaries. the symposium's two halves becoming one, the act of completion.
on the other, there is the progressive disclosure, the joys of flirting, and the play of masks. two distinct people with their own rich lives becoming a unit not by compulsion and lack but by affirmative choice.
the notifications alleviated the tendency the two had to spoil each other. an ambient sense of connection gave you that hint at a future act of completion without having to rush forward head-first into a destructively speedy merge.

he had spent so much time trying to think about what she was thinking, feeding an inner little voice of insecurity. for each proof of interest and care she sent his way, he made up a reason for her to be placating him and quickly emptied it of meaning. there was no way to do that with the notifications. they felt gentle and simple, they anchored the relationship into the purest expression of love. you think of someone and you smile, happy that they exist. everything beautiful reminds you of them.

she liked it, too. he had trouble expressing his feelings for her still, even with the blunt blabbering his enthusiasm inspired. he was guarded always. each time he told her how he felt, he had this impression that he was violating some sacred rule of etiquette; that it was unbecoming of him. so he did not do enough of it. now he had a way to tell her without telling her, and he could see it put her at ease just like it did him.

their relationship kept on going: evenings of cozy dates, lazy sunday afternoons together, and weekdays of notifications and messages.

5 years later, she was emerging from the study, looking startled by the outside world as always after a long session of writing.

by the time she realized he was here, his loving gaze had been on her for a few seconds. she promptly returned it. "what's for dinner?", she asked.

he had just finished reading the third chapter of her novel. he could see the marks of their long conversations in it, some of himself here and there. she was getting so much better at this. what he saw in her all these years ago was now at the surface, visible to all.

"oh it's a surprise, but one of your favorites, you'll love it", he answered, thinking about all the cooking he still had to do.
he took pride in supporting her. holding her to an ideal she had always been capable of reaching but didn't know she had in her. she still blushed when he complimented her writing. it took him a long time to convince her that it wasn't just that he was in love with her.

they had stopped using the app a long time ago now, but as crutches go it had been the sweetest. they didn't need it now, they had built an understanding of their own that didn't even need the slightest of helps.
