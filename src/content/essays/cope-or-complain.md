"Benevolence" is a common virtue or value exalted in a few contexts I've been in. In my experience, it means do not ruffle any feathers and do not point out what's wrong with the status quo. I've always been upset at that. I think it accounts for a large part of whether I'll like a community, a company, a relationship, or a person.

There are two ways to be an optimist. The first is convincing people that things aren't as bad as they seem and to share your inner contentment with the status quo. The second is to prod them to consider how much better things could be. I was always of the second school. If something is going well, then what is there to discuss?

I have a high sensitivity to incoherence: if something isn't what it ought or could be, then you will never stop hearing me going on about it.

There is something deeply personal to this stance, two different ways of seeing the world. It makes me clash with even people I agree on subject matters with. The other side will call me an idealist, perfectionist, too stubborn, or impatient. People who share my view, however, are allies for life.

I think it's tied to my hatred of any form of condescension, of patronizing. I want people to be straight with me and not pander, I'd rather have someone tell me what they think is wrong than focus on the good for the sake of shared happiness. If you think everything is great, then it's just a lack of imagination.

I think it's also largely tied to the notion of locus of control. If you believe you're the master of your destiny, then imperfections in the world are something for you and others to solve, and only will be preventing you from doing so. If not, then you'd better change yourself rather than change the state of things.

Cope or complain are the two ways of reacting to the suboptimal, but where the first one only promises settling down the second one at least has a shot at turning into a better future.
